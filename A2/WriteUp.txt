Name: Tzur Almog


I wrote all the code.

Sort was hard, I had trouble working out where the pipes where supposed to go.

Grep was easier, beccasue i did it earlier. 
I also had a weird error where it took the input as a binary file so I had to add a flag to make it work.

It also dosent work on the second grep file beccasse the size of the output causess a deadlock.

10/10 , would not do again.
